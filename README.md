# Drunk Driving


## Question 1 - Would an increase in law enforcement workforce decrease DUIs?

Find the correlation between law enforcement per capita and DUI's per capita. 

Law enforcement data was retrieved from Uniform Crime Reporting Data from FBI.GOV for the three years. 



## Question 2- Would prohibiting alcohol sales on Sundays decrease accidents?

Find the correlation between Sunday Alcohol Sales (restricted, prohibited, local, or permitted) and # of accidents.

Data for Sunday crashes caused by drunk drivers was found on the NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS).

## Question 3- Does the rate of accidents go up once DC Metro closes? 

Using the crash data obtained from opendata.dc.gov, we will visualize the rate of accidents as metro is closing and after it is closed. 

We can also test to see if closing metro early for Safetrack increased accidents. We need to find the dates of Safetrack and the general hours of operation for metro.
